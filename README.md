Hello, and welcomme to my git repository! 

I've recently taken up learning to program and have chosen web development to kickstart that process. I began working through The Odin Project curriculum a week ago,
learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript, so have a long way to go. Taking it one day at a time. 

I've always had an interest in computing and have been using computers since the mid 90's, dabbling with Linux and BSD here and there since then, just never took 
the time to dedicate myself to it, so I'm far from an expert. I've had a long career in engineering, and still love science and technology, so getting serious about
computer programming seemed a logical way to go.

Some current interests are human machine interface design, and troubleshooting old radios.
