Hello, and welcomme to my git repository! 

I've recently taken up learning to program and have chosen web development to kickstart that process. I'm currently working through The Odin Project curriculum
learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Taking it one day at a time, but have a long way to go! 

I've always had an interest in computing and have been using computers since the mid 90's, dabbling with Linux and BSD here and there since then, just never took 
the time to dedicate myself to it, so I'm far from an expert. I've had a long career in engineering, and still enjoy science and technology. 

Some current interests are human machine interface design, and troubleshooting old radios.
